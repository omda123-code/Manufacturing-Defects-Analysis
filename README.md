# üè≠ Manufacturing Defects Analysis

This repository contains a **comprehensive exploratory analysis** of a synthetic manufacturing dataset, focusing on factors affecting defect rates across production, supply chain, maintenance, workforce, energy efficiency, and additive manufacturing.

All analysis and visualizations were performed using **Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)**.  

All plots are saved in the `plots` folder and displayed below for quick reference.

## üìä Dataset Overview

The dataset includes key metrics related to:

- Production efficiency (`ProductionVolume`, `ProductionCost`)  
- Supplier quality (`SupplierQuality`, `DeliveryDelay`)  
- Quality control (`DefectRate`, `QualityScore`)  
- Maintenance (`MaintenanceHours`, `DowntimePercentage`)  
- Inventory (`InventoryTurnover`, `StockoutRate`)  
- Workforce (`WorkerProductivity`, `SafetyIncidents`)  
- Energy (`EnergyConsumption`, `EnergyEfficiency`)  
- Additive manufacturing (`AdditiveProcessTime`, `AdditiveMaterialCost`)  

The target variable is `DefectStatus`:

- **0 ‚Üí Low Defects**  
- **1 ‚Üí High Defects**

## üñºÔ∏è Visual Analysis

### 1. Avg Defect Rate by Energy Efficiency Quartile
![Energy Quartile vs Defect Rate](plots/16_energy_quartile_defect.png)  
- Observation: Defect rate ~2.7 across all quartiles.

### 2. Percentage of High Defect Batches
![High Defect Percentage](plots/15_high_defect_pct.png)  
- High Defect: 84%  
- Low Defect: 16%  
- Observation: Majority of batches are high-defect.

### 3. Extreme Production Volume vs Defect Rate
![Extreme Production](plots/14_extreme_production.png)  
- Observation: Wide scatter; defect rates vary independently of production volume.

### 4. Low Supplier Quality vs Defect Rate
![Low Supplier Quality](plots/13_low_supplier_defect.png)  
- Observation: Lower supplier quality shows higher variability in defect rates.

### 5. Defect Rate by Maintenance Level
![Maintenance Level vs Defect](plots/12_maintenance_defect.png)  
- Observation: Defect rate nearly constant (~2.7) across maintenance levels.

### 6. Avg Defect Rate by Production Cost Range
![Production Cost vs Defect](plots/11_cost_defect.png)  
- Observation: Production cost has minimal effect on defect rate.

### 7. Top 20 Defect-Prone Batches
![Top Defect Batches](plots/10_top_defect_batches.png)  
- Observation: Defect rates around ~5%, slight variation.

### 8. Additive Material Cost vs Process Time vs Defect Rate
![Additive Cost vs Time](plots/09_additive_cost_time.png)  
- Observation: No clear pattern; defect rate scattered.

### 9. Energy Efficiency vs Energy Consumption
![Energy vs Consumption](plots/08_energy_efficiency.png)  
- Observation: Defect rate not clearly linked to energy consumption.

### 10. Safety Incidents vs High Defect Batches
![Safety Incidents](plots/07_safety_defect.png)  
- Observation: Slight increase in high defects with more safety incidents.

### 11. Avg Defect Rate by Worker Productivity
![Worker Productivity](plots/06_worker_defect.png)  
- Observation: No clear trend; defect rates remain mixed.

### 12. Inventory Turnover vs Stockout Rate
![Inventory vs Stockout](plots/05_inventory_stockout.png)  
- Observation: High turnover does not guarantee low stockout risk.

### 13. Maintenance Hours vs Downtime %
![Maintenance vs Downtime](plots/04_maintenance_downtime.png)  
- Observation: High scatter; no clear linear pattern.

### 14. High Defect Batches vs Delivery Delay
![High Defect vs Delay](plots/03_high_defect_delivery.png)  
- Observation: No simple linear relationship.

### 15. Avg Defect Rate by Supplier Quality
![Supplier Quality vs Defect](plots/02_supplier_defect.png)  
- Observation: Scatter across quality levels; no strong correlation.

### 16. Top 10 Production Volumes vs Defect Rate
![Top Production vs Defect](plots/01_top_production_defects.png)  
- Observation: Defect rates range ~2‚Äì4%; no linear trend.

## üìå Observations & Insights
- High variability in defect rates across most factors.
- Energy efficiency, maintenance, and production cost show minimal effect on defect rate in this dataset.
- Majority of batches are high-defect (~84%).
- Scatter plots suggest no clear linear relationships; deeper statistical or ML analysis may reveal hidden patterns.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- Dataset is synthetic for educational purposes.
- Analysis focuses on exploratory data visualization, not causal inference.
- Further steps could include predictive modeling to estimate DefectStatus.
